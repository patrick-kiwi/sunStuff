Hallstatt's cycles are climatic variations with a period of about 2500 years.  [One theory][1], which [caused controversy][2] leading to a [paper retraction][3], is that the large planets are causing the cycles by wobbling the solar system's barycentre with respect to the sun's geometric centre, and that may cause time-dependent heating/cooling.  At first glance the theory is compelling because we know the orbital periods of Jupiter Saturn Uranus and Neptune (12, 29 84, and 165 years respectively), and we can get a first approximation of the barycentre wobbling by getting grok or chatGPT to [write some python][4] Jupyter-notebook code to models planet rotation as a cosine wave with the planet weights as amplitudes and orbital periods as wavelengths.  The graphed output from such code suggests that the large planets do wobble the barycentre a little bit with a period of about 2500 years.[![graph from simple orbital period analysis][5]][5]  
The question is *does that barycentre wobbling translate to heating or cooling here on earth?* We should be able to verify that by looking at the actual distance (d) between the earth's, and the sun's geometric centres. By assuming an inverse square law for the power flux received here on earth, and then integrating 1/d^2 with respect to time, we should get something proportional to the energy absorbed on earth for that given time period.  We can get discrete earth-sun distances from [NASA's Horizons repo][6] and then do numerical integration using the trapezoid rule.  The problem is that it doesn't work, or at least it shows that the energy received on earth isn't cyclically changing much.  To show that i calculated the difference in irradiance received in 2035 vs 2550 using earth-sun distances, and it's peanuts ~165kJ/m^2/year (5.2 mW/m^2).  Interestingly, that's not zero, but it's still insignificant. This leaves lots of questions, Is my analysis valid?  Is the NASA JPL data sufficiently accurate to model this?  If we assume that barycentre wobbling really has no effect on the earth-sun distance, then is it possible that planetary alignment could be affect the earth's energy budget in some other way which we don't understand?  It's a shame that Zharkova's paper was retracted.  The main thrust of her paper was uncovering the dynamo dynamics which lead to sunspot activity, and that seems like an uncontested breakthrough in understanding climate.  Suggestions or comments most welcome.
